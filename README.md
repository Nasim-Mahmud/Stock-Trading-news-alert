# Stock-Trading-news-alert
With the help of this project, you will be able to receive text-based stock trading alerts on your mobile device. This endeavor is a challenge task from Angela Yu's #100DaysOfCode.

In this project, we have used three different API. Those are:
<ol>For getting the STOCK PRIE, <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alphavantage</a></ol>
<ol>For getting the latest news, <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News API</a></ol>
<ol>For sending message, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a></ol>
<ol></ol>
