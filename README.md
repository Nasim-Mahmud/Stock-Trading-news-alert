# Stock-Trading-news-alert
With the help of this project, you will be able to receive text-based stock trading alerts on your mobile device. This endeavor is a challenge task from Angela Yu's #100DaysOfCode.

In this project, we have used three different API. Those are:
<ol>For getting the STOCK PRIE, <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alphavantage</a></ol>
<ol>For getting the latest news, <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News API</a></ol>
<ol>For sending message, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a></ol>

We retrieved API keys from <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alphavantage</a> and <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News API</a>, and API authentication key and account SID from <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.

This project will look up the stock price of the company you choose from the previous day and the day before, and if there is a price difference of more than 3%, it will notify you. Although I chose the Tesla Company for testing purposes, you are free to modify the proportion to anything you like.

Note that there is a cost associated with this functionality. During the trial period, you can send and receive up to $15 worth of messages to try it out. After that, if you want to keep using the service, you must pay for it.

Happy Coding! üòÅ
